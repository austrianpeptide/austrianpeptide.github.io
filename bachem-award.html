	    Nina Hartrampf is an Assistant Professor (tenure track) for “Next Generation Synthesis” at the University of Zurich. Her group’s current research interests are the development of new flow-based methods for peptide synthesis and modification, and their application to the investigation of post-translationally modified peptides and proteins. </p>
	    <p>She received a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry and Biochemistry as well as a Master’s degree in Chemistry from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. In 2013, she joined the group of Prof. Dr. Dirk Trauner for her graduate studies in natural product synthesis. After graduating summa cum laude in 2017, she joined the group of Prof. Bradley L. Pentelute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her postdoctoral work focused on the rapid high-fidelity synthesis of peptides and proteins using automated flow chemistry.</p></small>

	      Alexander has big interest in the integration of large biomedical data in genomics, structure biology, pharmacology, and epidemiology with innovative computational methods. He studied biomedical science at the University of Münster, Germany. During his PhD with David Gloriam at the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology in Copenhagen, he worked on novel analytical methods to identify human signaling systems and thereby discovered endogenous peptides activating several orphan receptors. Alexander had a research sabbatical with Madan Babu at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, where he was working on the impact of genetic variations on drug response. Subsequently, he received the “HC Ørsted Forskertalentpris” and “Bayer Pharmaceuticals Promotionspreis”. He is currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology in Copenhagen working on peptide hormones and personalised medicine.
